To run follow instructions

Task -1:

For Approach -1:
- Download Holistic Edge Detection pre-trained model and Deploy.prototxt from Here. (https://www.kaggle.com/code/baskarsettu/holistic-edge-detection) 
- download Dataset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dZgsgXN5L8fJqHHbPJalAyv3mixn58TH?usp=sharing)
- download the jupyter (.ipynb) file to run in Notebook or copy all code and paste into a Python IDE
- Then change the image directory
- Run all cells or code.
    
For Approach -2:
- download the jupyter (.ipynb) file to run in Notebook or copy all code and paste into a Python IDE
- download Dataset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dZgsgXN5L8fJqHHbPJalAyv3mixn58TH?usp=sharing)
- Then change the image directory
- Run all cells or code.

Task-2:
- download the jupyter (.ipynb) file to run in Notebook or copy all code and paste into a Python IDE
- Install necessary libraries
    * pip install opencv-python
    * pip install cmake
    * pip install dlib
- Download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat as shown in Notebook file.
- Then Run code
- A window will open to capture video (Must have camera in pc or laptop)
 
 Point to be Noted:
